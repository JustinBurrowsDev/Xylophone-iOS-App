# Xylophone

## Challenges I Faced?

Understanding how sound is going to play in my application is quite challenging at this current point in time.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

Collaboration with my peers gave me clearer understanding of how to play sound in my applications. Once I had a general idea of how to accomplish this feat, I began leveraging platforms like Google, YouTube, MDN docs, Stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, and reference guides. Through my combined research on these platforms I was able to find the proper Swift methods and functions needed to complete the task and I programmed the Xylophone accordingly.
